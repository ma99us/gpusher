# gpusher

GIT version control system is great, but:

  * Does your IDE GIT plugin constantly screwing up your files?
  * Do you only trust command line GIT tool, but tired of typing same commands over and over again?
  * Do you often want to push a few changed files into separate branch (for later merge request), and continue working on your main development branch?
  * Do you like simple and no-nonsense GUI tools?

   If you answered "Yes" to some of these questions, then you might like this G-Pusher tool. Check it out, itâ€™s free and open source.
